    # Overview
    The HMRC Assist report is generated using the customers’ National Insurance number (NINO), Calculation ID and Tax year. The report contains targeted messages contained within the JSON response for the customer.

    This API allows developers to:

    * retrieve a HMRC Assist report for a given customer with a list of messages for the customer
    * securely generate a report that is sent to or displayed after it has been generated
    * allow the client to acknowledge the report

      summary: Produce a HMRC Self Assessment Assist Report
      description: |
        This endpoint allows a developer to request a HMRC Assist report to be generated for a customer or their agent.

        <strong> A 200 OK response is returned when applicable messages are available, and a 204 No Content response is returned when there are no messages to report.</strong></p>

        ### Test data
        In the sandbox environment, responses are simulated based on specific Calculation IDs included in the request. Each Calculation ID corresponds to a predefined test scenario that defines the response outcome.
